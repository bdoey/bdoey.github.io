								<span class="image main"><img src="images/stocks_v2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections that make it a "general-purpose computer" for processing sequences of data. This allows it to store information over long sequences and is exceptionally well-suited for various time-series prediction tasks, such as stock market movements over a preiod of time.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/credit_risk1.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The primary goal of this notebook is to develop a machine learning model for credit risk assessment. The model aims to predict whether an individual is a credit risk based on various features such as income, employment history, and debt levels. The notebook provides a comprehensive workflow for credit risk assessment, from data preprocessing to model interpretability, making it a valuable asset for any financial institution.

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/sentiment_analysis1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This Jupyter notebook provides an advanced sentiment analysis framework tailored for investors focusing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. By leveraging Natural Language Processing and Topic Modeling, it goes beyond basic sentiment scores to offer a nuanced, topic-weighted sentiment analysis. This approach aims to give investors a more comprehensive understanding of market sentiment, thereby aiding in more informed and strategic investment decisions.

This allows it to store information over long sequences and is exceptionally well-suited for various time-series prediction tasks, such as stock market movements over a preiod of time. I break down this approach in 8 steps and then make a prediction for the S&P 500 for the next 4 months.
