    "# AI-Powered Financial Literacy Question-Answering System using Retrieval Augmented Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to combat financial illiteracy by developing an AI-powered question-answering system that utilizes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide personalized and informative responses to users' financial queries. The system leverages the power of large language models, advanced retrieval techniques, and the LangChain library to deliver accurate and context-aware answers, empowering users with the knowledge they need to make informed financial decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project begins by processing basic financial literacy textbooks, extracting and cleaning the text, and saving the cleaned text files for further use. These cleaned text documents are then loaded, split into chunks, and embedded using a pre-trained HuggingFace model. The embedded documents are used to fill a vector database, creating a comprehensive knowledge base for the question-answering system.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the most relevant information is retrieved for a given query, two retrievers, BM25 and FAISS, are created from the embedded documents, and an ensemble retriever combining both is set up. This ensemble approach enhances the relevance of the retrieved documents, enabling the system to provide more accurate and context-aware responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key aspect of this project is the use of Ollama, a platform that allows users to set up and run a locally hosted large language model. By integrating Ollama into the RAG pipeline, users can keep all their data on their local machine, eliminating the need to share sensitive financial information with third-party providers. This local hosting ensures data privacy and security, giving users peace of mind when interacting with the question-answering system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAG pipeline is completed by initializing an Ollama language model for generating responses and defining a custom prompt template that incorporates the user's financial situation and the context from the retrieved documents. A question-answering chain (RetrievalQA) is created using the ensemble retriever, the custom prompt, and the Ollama language model. The resulting system is tested with various financial queries, demonstrating its ability to provide detailed, relevant, and personalized responses by effectively combining the retrieved context with the language model's generative capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging the power of Retrieval Augmented Generation and locally hosted large language models, this project takes a significant step towards combating financial illiteracy. The AI-powered question-answering system empowers users with the knowledge and insights they need to navigate the complex world of personal finance, while ensuring the privacy and security of their sensitive financial information."

    "This part of the notebook focuses on importing the necessary libraries and modules for the AI-powered question-answering system. These libraries include LangChain, which provides a framework for building applications with large language models, as well as various document loaders, text splitters, embedding models, vector stores, retrievers, and language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of the approach:\n",
    "- The selected libraries, such as LangChain, offer a wide range of tools and utilities that simplify the process of building a question-answering system, making the development more efficient and organized.\n",
    "- By importing specific modules for document loading (e.g., CSVLoader, PyPDFLoader, TextLoader), text splitting (e.g., RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter), and embedding (e.g., HuggingFaceEmbeddings), you can easily handle different file formats and prepare the data for further processing.\n",
    "- The inclusion of various retriever models (e.g., BM25Retriever, EnsembleRetriever) allows for experimentation with different retrieval techniques to find the most suitable approach for your specific use case.\n",
    "- Importing the Ollama language model from LangChain enables you to leverage a powerful language model for generating high-quality responses.\n",
    "- The use of additional libraries like Transformers, PyTorch, and fitz provides access to state-of-the-art models, GPU acceleration, and PDF processing capabilities, enhancing the overall functionality and performance of the system."

The embedder is created using the HuggingFaceEmbeddings class, which is initialized with a pre-trained model (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5). The embedder is then wrapped with CacheBackedEmbeddings to enable caching of the embeddings using a LocalFileStore.\n",

      "2. Use a loan: If you don't have enough savings to buy a car outright, consider using a loan.

Make sure to compare interest rates and terms to find the best option for your financial situation.\n",

      "4. Consider used cars: If you're on a tight budget, buying a used car can be a more affordable option. Used cars are typically cheaper than new ones and can still meet your transportation needs. You can also consider buying a certified pre-owned (CPO) vehicle, which has been inspected and certified by the manufacturer or dealer.\n",
