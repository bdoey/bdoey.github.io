{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Overview\n","\n","This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to stock market analysis and trading. The goal is to leverage natural language processing (NLP) of financial news combined with quantitative trading algorithms to generate actionable insights for making profitable trades. Specifically, the project aims to analyze sentiment in news headlines about 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index, and correlate this sentiment with actual stock price movements over corresponding time periods. Sentiment refers to the tone of the text - whether it is positive, negative or neutral about a company. By quantifying and correlating sentiment signals in headlines with price changes, the system can identify predictive indicators.\n"," \n","These sentiment-based indicators can then be combined with traditional technical analysis strategies, like detecting trends and momentum in price charts, to generate more robust trading recommendations. The project implements a technical trading algorithm called MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) which detects crossover buy and sell signals in price charts. By merging sentiment analysis predictions with the MACD technical signals, the system can produce 1-5 recommendations for each stock ranging from \"Strong Buy\" to \"Strong Sell\". The recommendations are projected 1 week into the future based on current market conditions.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"f9fc9ff7b2514fb9a157d2283845327f","deepnote_app_block_visible":true,"deepnote_app_coordinates":{"h":5,"w":12,"x":0,"y":0},"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":["# Part 1: Sentiment Analysis"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"cell_id":"3aca2b7dfde74413b0f6da5ed97ade48","deepnote_app_block_visible":true,"deepnote_app_coordinates":{"h":5,"w":12,"x":0,"y":0},"deepnote_cell_type":"code","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"execution_millis":53587,"execution_start":1696524744745,"source_hash":null},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/shared-libs/python3.9/py/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tqdm/auto.py:22: TqdmWarning: IProgress not found.
